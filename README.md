ヾ( ˃ᴗ˂ )◞ • \*✰ Hi there!

This is a modified version of the js-cookbook, written by [chandru89new](https://github.com/chandru89new/js-cookbook), with the addition of typescript typings and tests.

Why did I do this? Well, I wanted to learn more about functional programming, and when I came across chandru89new's post in r/javascript, I was intrigued. I also wanted to learn more about typescript, so I decided to add typings to the functions. I also wanted to learn more about Deno tests, so I added tests for the functions.

They are all written in functional programming style, with heavy use of pipes and currying. They are also all typed, so they can be used with typescript.

The typings are still a work in progress, so they may not be 100% accurate. I'm still learning advanced typescript usage, and some of the functions require complicated types, so please let me know if you find any errors. I'm sure there are a lot of them! (≧▽≦)
